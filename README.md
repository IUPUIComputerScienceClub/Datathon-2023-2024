# Datathon 2023-2024

IUPUI's Computer Science Club is hosting a hackathon for students to practice and apply their programming skills. This event, titled *Datathon*, will focus on **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.

Please read through the rest of this document carefully - it will hopefully answer any questions you may have about the event. It will also help you to avoid any issues later. You can always ask questions if you have any.

## Who Can Participate?

This event is open to everyone! This includes (but is not limited to) Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors, Graduate students from any school at IUPUI. All entries will receive a free T-shirt by submitting their project to the hackathon.

## The Theme: Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
Data Science, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning have become extremely popular fields for computer scientists and software engineers to focus on to develop their skills. While not always the focus, developing a basic understanding of these fields will put you in a good position to succeed as these field continue to grow. Do you know how to analyze & present data? Do you know how to view data in a way that is relevant to the problem at hand? Can you either build models to solve your problems or use open-source models to your advantage? If yes, this is your chance to show us what you've got! If not, this is your chance to gain some valuable experience and skills that will put you above the rest. Either way, come join us at the Datathon!

Maybe this theme isn't quite your thing... if that is the case, you are still welcome to participate by making any project you feel like making. While you may not be competitive for categories, it will be a great excuse to get some practice in anyway!

## When Is This Event Taking Place?
The event will take place starting the week of Monday, March 18th, and lasting until Sunday, March 24th (for IUPUI students, this is the week after Spring Break). You will have from the kickoff event on Monday until Sunday to complete your project. While the competition can be done entirely online, if you need to ask questions it will be best to talk to a club officer in person during one of the times. We will have food & drinks during the kickoff event, as well as a presentation to go over the event!

* Monday, March 18th, *Location TBD*  (Event Kickoff & Start)
* *Workshop Times & Dates TBD*
* Sunday, March 24th, *Location TBD*

## Categories
We will have the categories comming soon!

## Rules
The rules for this event aren't a lot, but please stick to them:

### NO School-Inappropriate Content

Please refrain from creating anything that would be considered inappropriate for an educational/school setting. Inappropriate submissions will be immediately disqualified from the event and reported to the school.
*If you have any concerns about your project, please speak with a club officer. 

### NO Plagiarism

This is your chance to learn something new and apply it, not rip off someone else's work. While it is acceptable to learn how to do something when you don't already know, copying and pasting code or copying entire projects is not what this event is about. This also means that you are to refrain from simply taking a previous project and submitting it or modifying it for this event. We want to see what you can do in the time given.

## Examples for Beginners
We expect there to be some complete beginners for this competition, and that's perfectly okay! We have some examples for you created by our officers if you need them. We will include more information on these once they have finalized.

*You are not required to use any of the examples given here. These are meant to be starting points or reference material for in case anyone needs it.

## Submission Details

*Submission Details have not been finalized, however they will likely be similar to what is below:*

For this event, we will be having you submit your project using a Canvas. When you are finished with your project, you will be asked to upload the following to the canvas page:
* **your name (or your group name w/your members' names)**
* **your project's name** - if you a category, your project needs a cool name so it can be recognized!
* **Project Code** - All of the scripts/code you wrote to run the project.
* **Competition** - Which competition is your submission for? (Front End or Full Stack).
* **Categories** - The categories you are wanting to compete for. We will still consider you for all of the categories in your competition (not required, but helpful!). We will still consider you for all categories, this just helps us to know what you focused on.
* **Project Documentation** - All of the documentation you made for the project, as well as anything else you may wish to share - project workflows, diagrams, planning tools, etc.
* **A Video Presentation** - A video of you going over the project. Tell us what we need to know about the project. Your ability to present your work is important too! Communicating your work with others is an important skill that you cannot do without. Try to keep it short - only tell us what we need to know while going over what you think is important and notable about your project.

**The Canvas Course name is: Computer Science Club at IUPUI. You can visit it [here](https://iu.instructure.com/enroll/BPAWRG)**

Projects can begin on Monday, March 18th, at *Time TBD*, and are due by 11:59 pm on Sunday, March 24th.

*Submissions will NOT be accepted past the deadline. Everyone has the same amount of time to work on their projects. Please ask if you have any questions. If you wish to submit after the deadline anyway, you can, but you will be inelligible for winning a category. If you are not finished and are worried about missing the deadline, submit what you have first then keep working.

## Other Details
We would like to keep a record of the projects that are submitted so we can promote the club later as well as keep track of club growth. We also believe there may be some learning opportunities from looking at where projects excelled or fell short. Of course, your project is yours and yours alone. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask the club officers.
